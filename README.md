# 🤖 Scikit-learn Exercises

Welcome to my personal collection of exercises and mini-projects using [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/), the most popular machine learning library in Python.

This folder is part of my learning journey through the **Programming for Machine Learning** course at Noroff.

## 📚 What's inside?

Each Python script in this folder focuses on a specific skill or concept related to preprocessing, training, and evaluating machine learning models.

### ✅ Topics covered so far:

- Handling missing values with `SimpleImputer`
- Encoding categorical variables with `OneHotEncoder` and `OrdinalEncoder`
- Creating custom transformations using `FunctionTransformer`
- Feature binning with `KBinsDiscretizer`
- Binarization with `Binarizer` and custom logic
- Label encoding with `LabelEncoder` (when appropriate)
- Building clean preprocessing pipelines

---

## 📂 Structure

Each exercise or task is written as a standalone Python script, usually with:

- A short task description as a comment or docstring
- Clear, commented code using best practices
- A `print()` at the end to show the resulting transformed data

---

## 🛠️ Tools used

- Python 3
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn

---

## 🚀 How to run the scripts

1. Clone the repository or download this folder.
2. Make sure you have the required libraries:
    - pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy
3. Run any script you like:
    - python imputation_and_onehot_encoding.py

## 🎯 Goal

My goal with this folder is to build a solid foundation in data preprocessing and machine learning pipelines using scikit-learn — and to keep my code clean and ready for future projects or job applications.

## 🧠 Still learning...

I'm documenting and improving each script as I learn. If you have tips, suggestions, or feedback, feel free to open an issue or contact me.
